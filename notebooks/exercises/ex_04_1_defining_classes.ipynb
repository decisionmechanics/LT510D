    "Become familiar with creating classes by producing abstractions of standard playing cards. A standard deck of 52 playing cards is a common basis for many popular and entertaining games, including Poker, Bridge, Hearts, Euchre, Blackjack, Cribbage, Crazy Eights, Fish---or even your favorite! If you were to program any of these games in C#, creating a `PlayingCard` class would be a good place to start. This abstraction of playing cards will form the basis of the business logic for our game, \"The Eyes Have It.\"\n",
